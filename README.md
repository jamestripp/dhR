## Next Session

The next session will be at 12:00 on the 30th of March 2023. This is our first session so will focus on what R is and give us chance to introduce ourselves. You can find the code for this session here.

## Why R?

Humanists often use data to construct arguments and R is a programming language which focuses on data analysis. Therefore learning R can help you to be a better humanist and, in my opinion, is also rather fun.

Working in R can also help to teach you computational thinking skills. That is, breaking up a task into logical components which you tell the computer to do. For instance,

1.  Open the complete works of Shakespeare
2.  Count the number of times the word love is used by play
3.  Put the data into a table
4.  Create a figure to communicate your findings

R can do a lot of different things. These include:

-   Maps

-   Producing publication quality figures

-   Natural Language Processing

-   Machine learning models

-   Websites

-   and so on
